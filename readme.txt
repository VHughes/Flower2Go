A ‘readme.txt’ file containing your name (full name), student ID, completion of the project (e.g., 100% complete), any set up instructions, and a quick summary of things that went well, things that didn’t go as expected, and anything you would do differently next time

Student Names:

username: Arron
password: 1234

** If you hit "Shop" you are brought to the user shopping cart where you can shop and checkout. Be sure to start the cart before shopping **

** If you login in as an admin, you are brought to your profile page, where you can then add, delete or update items to the shopping cart **

** When creating a user, the password encrypts, and is sent to the database, however upon further research, it was found that md5 is a one-way hash, and decrypting it is nearly impossible. With limited time and resources, we could not use an alternative way to decrypt the password. To prove that all login functions are up and working, feel free to try "11" "11" as the username and password, or "virginia" "hughes" **

** You have to log out before you can log back in **

Things that don't work:
- Decryption of the password
- Depletion of the quantity of available products as the users shop
-
