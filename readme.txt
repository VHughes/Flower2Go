** Changet the DB password in DBConnector from "password" to "root" **

** If you hit "Shop" you are brought to the user shopping cart where you can shop and checkout. Be sure to start the cart before shopping **

** If you login in as an admin, you are brought to your profile page, where you can then add, delete or update items to the shopping cart **

** When creating a user, the password encrypts, and is sent to the database, however upon further research, it was found that md5 is a one-way hash, and decrypting it is nearly impossible. With limited time and resources, we could not use an alternative way to decrypt the password. To prove that all login functions are up and working, feel free to try "11" "11" as the username and password, or "virginia" "hughes" **

** You have to log out before you can log back in **

Things that don't work:
- Decryption of the password
- Depletion of the quantity of available products as the users shop

Project completion: 80%

Things that went well:
- Updating/deleting from the database. Once a database connection was established and we could add new items, updating and deleting were quite simple

Things that were challenging:
- Multiple files made finding bugs incredibly difficult
- Disprencies between previous MVC knowledge and comfortability and the files given for this project
- Discrepency between my PC and Alexis' Mac

Things I would do differently:
- Hire someone to do it differently
- Get a tutor

Final Thoughts:
- This was a very challenging project, and many students felt it was beyond the scope of our capabilites
